## Sprint 5 Authentication Persistence Contract

Edwin's Sprint 5 frontend work will consolidate the existing local-storage authentication helpers into one authoritative session-restoration flow. This section defines the contract only. The provider, storage service, protected-route guard, and backend verification integration are implemented in later phases.

### Authoritative authentication state

```text
user: verified user or null
accessToken: stored access token or null
isAuthenticated: true only after backend verification succeeds
isRestoringSession: true while startup verification is running
isAuthReady: true only after restoration has completed
error: sanitized authentication error or null
```

State invariants:

- `isRestoringSession=true` requires `isAuthReady=false`.
- The router must not redirect while `isAuthReady=false`.
- `isAuthenticated=true` requires both a verified user and an access token.
- Failed, expired, malformed, or rejected sessions clear the user and token.
- Logout clears every recognized authentication storage key.

### Session restoration sequence

1. The application starts with session restoration active.
2. The canonical `token` key is read first.
3. Legacy token keys `authToken`, `jwt`, and `accessToken` may be read temporarily for compatibility.
4. A missing token completes restoration as unauthenticated.
5. An existing token is sent to the backend using `Authorization: Bearer <access-token>`.
6. A successful backend response restores the verified user.
7. An unauthorized, expired, malformed, or rejected session clears stored authentication data.
8. Restoration completes in a `finally` path.
9. `isAuthReady` becomes true.
10. The router renders the correct public or protected destination.

### Storage policy

```text
Canonical access-token key: token
Canonical user key: user
Legacy token keys: authToken, jwt, accessToken
Legacy role keys: role, isAdmin
Storage mechanism: localStorage
```

A valid legacy token may be migrated to the canonical `token` key during restoration. Invalid-session cleanup and logout must remove canonical and legacy authentication keys. JWT values must never be written to logs or user-facing error messages.

### Backend verification contract

Backend verification is authoritative. The frontend must not decode a JWT and treat its payload as proof of validity.

Expected request:

```text
Method: pending Devine confirmation
Endpoint: pending Devine confirmation
Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
```

Expected successful result:

```text
valid: true
user: { id, email, name?, role?, isAdmin? }
```

Expected failure result:

```text
valid: false
code: UNAUTHORIZED | TOKEN_EXPIRED | INVALID_TOKEN | SESSION_VERIFICATION_FAILED
message: optional sanitized message
```

The current backend contains login routes and JWT authentication middleware, but it does not yet expose a confirmed session-verification route. Devine must confirm the endpoint, HTTP method, response shape, invalid-token behavior, expired-token behavior, and refresh-token policy before live restoration is connected.

### Routing safety contract

```text
Authentication unresolved -> render a bootstrap/loading state
Authentication ready and verified -> render protected content
Authentication ready and unauthenticated -> redirect to login
Authenticated user visiting login -> redirect to the intended destination or dashboard
```

The active router remains `src/app/App.tsx`. The unused `src/app/routes.tsx` configuration must not become a second active router during authentication implementation.

### Security rules

- Never treat local JWT decoding as authentication proof.
- Never log access tokens, JWT payloads, or authorization headers.
- Never place backend secrets in frontend environment variables.
- Clear malformed and rejected sessions safely.
- Return sanitized errors to the UI.
- Do not redirect before restoration completes.
- Preserve the requested protected destination where practical.

## Sprint 5 Authentication Persistence Validation

The authentication persistence flow is validated with deterministic in-memory storage and an injectable mock verification API contract. Validation covers login storage, refresh and browser-reopen restoration, protected-route access after successful verification, expired and invalid token cleanup, unauthorized redirects, safe network-failure handling, logout cleanup, and token-redaction checks.

Run the validation with:

```text
npm run test:auth-persistence
```

Live backend verification remains pending Devine confirmation. The expected frontend endpoint is `GET /api/auth/session` with `Authorization: Bearer <access-token>`. The current backend does not expose that route, and `backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js` contains unresolved merge-conflict markers. The frontend does not use local JWT decoding as proof of authentication.

## Sprint 5 Frontend API Environment

The frontend reads its public API origin from `VITE_API_BASE_URL`. API paths are joined through `src/api/client.ts`, and trailing slashes are normalized before requests are built.

Copy `.env.example` to an ignored environment file and replace the placeholder with the deployment owner-approved API origin.

Development example:

```text
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Production example:

```text
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://approved-production-api.example.com
```

The production value above is a placeholder. A valid absolute HTTP or HTTPS URL is required at build time. Only public `VITE_` variables may be exposed to frontend code. Database URLs, JWT secrets, Cloudinary secrets, email credentials, private keys, and other backend credentials must never be placed in frontend environment files.

Validation commands:

```text
npm run test:api-config
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://approved-production-api.example.com npm run build
```
